    "### 1. The Vanishing Gradient Problem (Learning Speed)\n",
    "When using a Sigmoid activation function with MSE, the gradient becomes very small when the prediction is \"very wrong\" (e.g., predicting 0.99 for a label of 0). This leads to extremely slow convergence. Cross-Entropy's derivative cancels out the Sigmoid derivative's \"flatness,\" ensuring a strong gradient when the error is high.\n",
