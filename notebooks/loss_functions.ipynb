    "## Why Use Cross-Entropy instead of MSE for Classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "While Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the go-to for regression, it is rarely used for classification tasks involving probabilities. Here are the two primary reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Vanishing Gradient Problem (Learning Speed)\n",
    "When using a Sigmoid activation function with MSE, the gradient becomes very small when the prediction is \"very wrong\" (e.g., predicting 0.99 for a label of 0). This leads to extremely slow convergence. Cross-Entropy's derivative cancels out the Sigmoid derivative's \"flatness,\" ensuring a strong gradient when the error is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Non-Convexity\n",
    "For logistic regression, MSE results in a **non-convex** loss surface with many local minima. Cross-Entropy, however, is **convex**, guaranteeing that gradient descent can find the global minimum."
