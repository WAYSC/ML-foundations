    "## Why Use Cross-Entropy instead of MSE for Classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "While Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the go-to for regression, it is rarely used for classification tasks involving probabilities. Here are the two primary reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Vanishing Gradient Problem (Learning Speed)\n",
    "When using a Sigmoid activation function with MSE, the gradient becomes very small when the prediction is \"very wrong\" (e.g., predicting 0.99 for a label of 0). This leads to extremely slow convergence. Cross-Entropy's derivative cancels out the Sigmoid derivative's \"flatness,\" ensuring a strong gradient when the error is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Non-Convexity\n",
    "For logistic regression, MSE results in a **non-convex** loss surface with many local minima. Cross-Entropy, however, is **convex**, guaranteeing that gradient descent can find the global minimum."

    "The derivative of MSE with respect to the weights involves $\\sigma'(z)$. As $\\sigma(z)$ approaches 0 or 1 (the \"flat\" regions of the curve), $\\sigma'(z)$ becomes nearly zero. This causes the weights to stop updating, a phenomenon known as **gradient saturation**.\n",

This leaves a gradient that is proportional to the linear error $(y - \\hat{y})$, meaning the model learns faster when it is further from the truth."
