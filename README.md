**Machine Learning Fundamentals & PyTorch Workflow**

This repository documents my understanding of **machine learning fundamentals** and the **PyTorch training workflow**, with a focus on:

- 🧠 data–model alignment  
- 🔁 end-to-end training pipelines  
- 🏗️ engineering-oriented best practices  

The goal of this project is not just to *use* machine learning models, but to **understand how and why they work**, and how to organize ML code in a reusable and scalable way.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a **clear mental model** of the ML pipeline  
- Understand how **data, models, loss functions, and optimizers interact**
- Practice **transfer learning** and model adaptation
- Develop **engineering habits** for ML projects (modularity, experiments, reproducibility)
- Create a long-term, well-documented **learning trace on GitHub**

## 🧠 Learning Scope

This repository covers (and will continue to expand on):

- 🔹 What is Machine Learning?
- 🔹 Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- 🔹 ML Pipeline (data → model → loss → optimization → evaluation)
- 🔹 PyTorch fundamentals (tensors, autograd, modules)
- 🔹 Data preprocessing & transforms
- 🔹 Transfer learning & fine-tuning
- 🔹 Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix)
- 🔹 Visualization & error analysis
- 🔹 Notebook-driven experimentation vs script-based engineering

## 📌 Notes

This repository is primarily a **learning and thinking space**, not a polished library.  
Clarity, correctness, and understanding are prioritized over speed.

If you are also learning machine learning and PyTorch, feel free to explore and adapt the structure.
